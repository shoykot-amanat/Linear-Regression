# Machine Learning Regression Model.

This project is part of my learning journey inspired by Krish Naik's lectures. In this repository, I have implemented simple and multiple linear regression models using Python and the scikit-learn library.

### Key Components:
- *Data Visualization*: Explored and visualized the dataset using Matplotlib to gain insights into the relationships between variables.

- *Model Implementation*: Utilized the Seaborn library for implementing machine learning models, specifically focusing on simple and multiple linear regression.

- *Performance Evaluation*: Assessed the performance of the models by calculating key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared.

### Notebooks:
1. *Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb*: Implemented a simple linear regression model and visualized the results.

2. *Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb*: Extended the analysis to multiple linear regression, exploring relationships among multiple independent variables.

Feel free to explore the notebooks, provide feedback, or use this as a reference for your own machine learning projects. Happy learning!
